     * Gets a reactive streams [[org.reactivestreams.Subscriber]] with
     * batching capabilities for some phantom [[CassandraTable]]. This
     * subscriber is able to work for both finite short-lived streams
     * and never-ending long-lived streams. For the latter, a flushInterval
     * parameter can be used.
     *
     * @param batchSize the number of elements to include in the Cassandra batch
     * @param concurrentRequests the number of concurrent batch operations
     * @param batchType the type of the batch.
     *                  @see See [[http://docs.datastax.com/en/cql/3.1/cql/cql_reference/batch_r.html]] for further
     *                       explanation.
     * @param flushInterval used to schedule periodic batch execution even though the number of statements hasn't
     *                      been reached yet. Useful in never-ending streams that will never been completed.
     * @param completionFn a function that will be invoked when the stream is completed
     * @param errorFn a function that will be invoked when an error occurs
     * @param maxRetries maximum number of retries per batch
     * @param builder an implicitly resolved [[RequestBuilder]] that wraps a phantom [[com.websudos.phantom.builder.query.ExecutableStatement]].
     *                Every T element that gets into the stream from the upstream is turned into a ExecutableStatement
     *                by means of this builder.
     * @param system the underlying [[ActorSystem]]. This [[org.reactivestreams.Subscriber]] implementation uses Akka
     *               actors, but is not restricted to be used in the context of Akka Streams.
     * @param session the Cassandra [[com.datastax.driver.core.Session]]
     * @param space the Cassandra [[KeySpace]]
     * @param ev an evidence to get the T type removed by erasure
     * @tparam CT the concrete type inheriting from [[CassandraTable]]
     * @tparam T the type of the streamed element
     * @return the [[org.reactivestreams.Subscriber]] to be connected to a reactive stream typically initiated by
     *         a [[org.reactivestreams.Publisher]]
